# cs554-final-project
## Core Features
- Authentication: Users (mentors, mentees, and admins) will register and log in through Firebase Authentication, gaining access based on their role.
- Announcements Page: This page will allow admins to post important updates, announcements, and notifications, which will be visible to both mentors and mentees.
- Mentor/Mentee Directory: We will implement a searchable directory for users to view profiles of all mentors and mentees, enhancing communication and networking within the program.
- Profile Pages: Each user will have a personalized profile page displaying their information, including contact details, progress, and key achievements.
- Settings Page: This feature will allow users to adjust their account settings and preferences, such as profile visibility and notification preferences.
- Export Data: We will build functionality to export directory and form data (mentee/mentor information and responses) as CSV files for easy reporting and offline management.
- Dockerization: Containerizing the application using Docker will help with consistent development environments and streamlined deployment processes.

## Extra/Reach Features
- Growth Visualization: A potential additional feature is a visual component, such as a growth graph or collage of companies that mentors work at, enhancing user engagement and program appeal.
- Form Builder: Admins will have the ability to create and manage custom forms for mentees and mentors to submit feedback, event attendance, and track outcomes such as job placements.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Ensuring the platform is fully responsive on mobile devices will be critical for mentees and mentors accessing the platform on the go.
