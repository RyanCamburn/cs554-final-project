- Using Firebase Auth
- Using [next-firebase-auth-edge library](https://github.com/awinogrodzki/next-firebase-auth-edge/tree/main)
- Instead of storing roles (admin, mentor, mentee) user objects going to use Firebase Claims to manage roles
  - Don't store additional information in the claims cause it can cause performance issues
